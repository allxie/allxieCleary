		<h3> Environment </h3>
		<p>
			For my senior year in college, I lived without buying or receiving any new plastic. I wrote a thesis on how plastic consumption contributes to environmental, health, and social problems and how consumers can reduce their plastic intake. Passionate about reducing ocean garbage and the problems that come with recycling, I continue to live without buying any food that comes in plastic, and I volunteer to clean up beaches.

		<h3>Social Justice</h3>
		<p>
			I want to help provide equal opportunity for people of all genders, races, orientations, and backgrounds. I value social and emotional education to help people learn about communication, empathy, and constructive criticism. I care about sex and consent education, and education about health, fitness, and nutrition.

		<h3>Fabrication</h3>
		<p>
			While my favorite medium is software, I also design and build in the real world. I am a blacksmith and welder, and I have prototyped assistive technology and environmental technology using metal, plastic, wood, and fabric. I know my way around a machine shop. I've also dabbled with 3D modeling and printing.
