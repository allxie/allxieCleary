		<h2> Education </h2>
		<p>
			I'm driven by the pursuit of knowledge, and thus my personal culture can largely be summorized by the education I've chosen. I developed lifelong values around learning by doing, deep narritive feedback, social and emotional intelligence, and passion-based learning at the Nueva School in Hillsborough. For my 8th grade project, I reached out to David Kelley of IDEO and got to lead a team of five IDEO engineers to build a hovercraft. I attend the IDEO bootcamp, which has inspired the way I've learned since.

			Hampshire College in Amherst Massachusets has no majors, no grades, and no tests, so I cultivated my independence and internal drive to learn and produce excellent work. I wanted to learn everything, so I studied computer science, fabrication, design, engineering, and social entrepreneurship. For my senior year, I lived without buying or recieving any new plastic. I wrote a hundred page thesis on how plastic consumption contributes to environmental, health, and social problems and how consumers can reduce their plastic intake. Passionate about reducing ocean garbage and the problems that come with recycling, I continue to live without buying any food that comes in plastic.

			I recently graduated from General Assembly's 12 week Web Development Bootcamp during which I spent about 70 hours a week programming. Honestly, I'm not sure why I've ever done anything else. Programming is magical.

		<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
		<p>
			As I am perpetually seeking education that values passion-based study, it follows that my hobbies are numerous and eclectic. I work with metal and I blacksmith. I love to hike and ski and play tennis. I sing and enjoy trying new food and new restaurants. I get a lot out of cleaning trash off the beach. I also like cooking food over open fires on the beach. I'm also a hypnotist, which, practically speaking, involves more time explaining that hypnosis is a real psychological phenomenon than it does actually hypnotizing people. (But seriously, it's a real thing).

			And I'm a programmer, of course.
