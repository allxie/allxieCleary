			Uh, so, CleanSpeech, like, helps people remove filler words and buzzwords from their presentations and speeches. Using Google's voice recognition API, this app allows a user to input words they'd like to avoid, practice their speech aloud to the app, and receive graphs comparing the buzzwords used in each speech attempt.

			Nawdler is an app to help busy people understand their routines. Nawdler can help a user figure out why they're always five minutes late to work or how they spend their day as a stay-at-home parent. Users can enter steps in their routine, time them and add to them in any order, and view comparative analytics.

			I learned Angular and Ionic during the project week to make this an App Store ready product. I learned pair programming techniques with my partner. We started by discussing each other's learning styles, rigorously planned and wireframed the project, and had a smooth week of creating features, testing, and debugging.

			Builds Character is a tool for role playing gamers, DMs, and dice game makers to streamline the process of building games and characters. The app contains the following features:
			<br>

			<b>Dice Simulator:</b>
			<br>

			Takes a number of dice to sum, the number of sides on the dice, and a constant to add.
			<br>
			<b>Dice Stat Generator:</b>
			<br>

			Takes two "rolls" and generates a graph about which of the two rolls would score more highly or "win" what percent of the time, and another graph of the spread of results for each roll. This tool can help roleplaying game developers decide what types of roles to use for which aspects of their game to maintain balance.
			<br>
			<b>Character Builder Tool:</b>
			<br>
			Randomly generates a name (which is Italian--it's a feature, not a bug) which can be replaced with a custom name. Takes a description, gender, and species. The user can add as many stats as they want, lable the stats, and manually input the stat values or randomly generate them with a customized roll of dice. The user can save the characters that they have created.
